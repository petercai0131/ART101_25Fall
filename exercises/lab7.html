        <p><b>Nice Block 1 — The Mini Manifesto.</b> Curiosity is a muscle: stretch it, stress it, let it ache a little,
            then watch it grow.
            Today’s click is a tiny rebellion against boredom—one tap to peel back the surface and discover a brighter
            layer underneath.</p>

        <p><b>Nice Block 2 — Pocket Travelogue.</b> Somewhere between a coffee stain and a bus ticket, a new plan
            appears.
            If the map feels wrong, redraw it; if the road feels long, rename it an adventure. Pocket the sun; we move
            at our own orbit.</p>

        <p><b>Nice Block 3 — Studio Notes.</b> Rough ideas are just future classics wearing pajamas.
            Save often, experiment loudly, and keep the mistakes—they’re the breadcrumbs that lead you back to something
            honest.</p>

        <p><b>Nice Block 4 — Quiet Upgrade.</b> The best optimizations are invisible: a calmer mind, a kinder word, a
            sharper focus.
            Close the extra tabs in your head; keep the one that opens to possibility.</p>
